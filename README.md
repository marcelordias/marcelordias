### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there!  

Iâ€™m Marcelo â€” someone who loves to **learn by building** (and breaking) things.  
Most of my repos are experiments: little games, algorithms, and hackathon ideas that are more about **curiosity and fun** than perfection.  

Coding, for me, is like a playground:  
sometimes it works, sometimes it crashes, but I always learn something along the way.  

---

## ðŸ’» What I Play With
- Java & Android â€“ building simple games with a twist  
- JavaScript (p5.js) â€“ turning ideas into colorful pixels  
- Python â€“ experimenting with AI & search algorithms  
- TypeScript & AWS â€“ cloud projects from hackathons  

---

## ðŸŽ® Whatâ€™s in My Repos?
- Mini-games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect 4â€¦ with a sprinkle of chaos)  
- AI experiments (DFS, UCS, A*, you name it)  
- Hackathon projects (cloud + creativity = fun)  
- Random stuff that probably shouldnâ€™t run in production (but hey, itâ€™s fun to try)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> My code isnâ€™t about polished apps.  
> Itâ€™s a **timeline of me learning, failing, laughing, and trying again**.  
> If it breaks, congrats â€” you just learned something too. ðŸš€
